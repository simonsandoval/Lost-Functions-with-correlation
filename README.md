# Lost-Functions-with-correlation

This is a Lost Function to incorporate the correlation between variables, when it needs estimate a set of variables with correlation between them.

This loss function integrates both the traditional Mean Squared Error (MSE) for individual variable accuracy and a correlation-based penalty to preserve the interdependencies among key forest structural variables. 

The architecture of the ANN was designed to estimate each variable, while MSE is effective in minimizing individual prediction errors. It does not inherently account for the biological correlations among these variables. For instance, to predict forest variables, Volume and Biomass are heavily influenced by structural attributes like Height, Basal Area, and Stand density.
